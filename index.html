            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <img src="profile.jpg" alt="Younes Aboudrar" width="150" height="150">
            <p>Hi, I’m Younes Aboudrar, a dedicated first-year electrical engineering student at ENSEM Casa, with a deep passion for the digitalization of industrial processes. My journey in engineering began with two years of rigorous preparatory classes at Reda Slaoui, where I developed a strong foundation in mathematics, physics, and the principles of engineering.</p>
            <p>During my preparatory years, I discovered my interest in programming, particularly in how code can be leveraged to optimize and innovate industrial systems. This led me to focus on low-level and industrial-based programming, where I’ve gained proficiency in languages like Python, Rust, C, C++, and Assembly. My aim is to bridge the gap between traditional electrical engineering and modern digital solutions, creating more efficient and intelligent industrial processes.</p>
            <p>Currently, I’m pursuing my electrical engineering degree at ENSEM Casa, with an expected graduation in 2027. My coursework includes Digital Systems, Programming for Engineers, and Industrial Automation, which are directly aligned with my interests. I’m eager to apply my skills in real-world projects and continue learning about the latest technologies in the field.</p>
            <p>Outside of academics, I enjoy working on personal projects, such as building small-scale automation systems and developing software tools for data analysis. I’m also an avid learner, always seeking to expand my knowledge through online courses and technical literature. My goal is to become a leading engineer in the digital transformation of industries, driving innovation at the intersection of code and industrial applications.</p>
